        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The **Giant Panda** (*Ailuropoda melanoleuca*), also known as **panda bear** or simply **panda**, is a **bear native to south-central China**. It is easily recognizable by its **large, black patches** around the **eyes, ears, and across its round body**. The name **"giant panda"** helps distinguish it from the **unrelated red panda**.</p>

        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Though pandas belong to the **order Carnivora**, their diet consists of **over 99% bamboo**. In the wild, they occasionally consume **other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat**, including **birds, rodents, or carrion**. In captivity, they may also receive **honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas**, along with **specially prepared food**.</p>

        <h3>Habitat & Conservation</h3>
        <p>Giant pandas inhabit **mountain ranges in central China**, primarily **Sichuan province**, as well as **neighboring provinces Shaanxi and Gansu**. Due to **farming, deforestation, and urban development**, pandas have been **driven out of their historical lowland habitats**.</p>

        <p>The **giant panda is a conservation-reliant endangered species**, meaning its survival depends heavily on **conservation efforts and human intervention**.</p>

        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
        <p>You will find the pandas at **Panda Canyon**.</p>
