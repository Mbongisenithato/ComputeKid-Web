        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>*Phacochoerus* is a genus of wild pigs belonging to the **Suidae family**, commonly known as **warthogs**. It is the sole genus in the subfamily **Phacochoerinae**, thriving in **open and semiopen habitats** across **sub-Saharan Africa**, including **arid regions**.</p>

        <h3>Species & Classification</h3>
        <p>Warthogs are divided into **two main species**:  
        - The **desert warthog** (*Phacochoerus aethiopicus*).  
        - The **common warthog** (*Phacochoerus africanus*), which is the **most widespread species**.</p>

        <p>Historically, both species were classified under the same scientific name (*Phacochoerus aethiopicus*), but modern classifications **differentiate them**.</p>

        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Warthogs are **covered in bristly hairs**, though from a distance their **bodies and heads appear largely naked**. Only their **crest along the back** and **cheek and tail tufts** are noticeably haired. Their **distinctive facial wattles**, particularly in males, contribute to their rugged appearance.</p>

        <p>They also have **very distinct tusks**, which grow **between 25.5 and 63.5 cm (10.0 to 25.0 in) in males** but are **smaller in females**.</p>

        <h3>Diet & Conservation</h3>
        <p>Warthogs are **largely herbivorous**, feeding mainly on **grass, roots, and fruits**, though they occasionally eat **small animals**.  
        Despite habitat challenges, both species **remain fairly common and widespread**, earning them a **Least Concern** conservation status from the **IUCN**.</p>

        <p>However, the **Cape warthog**, a subspecies of the **desert warthog**, **became extinct around 1865**.</p>

        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
        <p>You will find the warthogs at **WA11, near the elephant enclosure**.</p>
