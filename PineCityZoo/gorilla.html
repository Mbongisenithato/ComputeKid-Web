        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Gorillas are **ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes** that **inhabit the forests of central Africa**. The genus *Gorilla* is **divided into two species**: the **eastern gorillas** and **western gorillas**, with **four or five recognized subspecies**. They are the **largest living primates by physical size**.</p>

        <h3>Genetic Similarity</h3>
        <p>Gorillas' **DNA is highly similar to that of humans**, ranging **from 95% to 99%** depending on what is counted. They are **our closest living relatives after chimpanzees and bonobos**.</p>

        <h3>Habitat & Distribution</h3>
        <p>Gorillas naturally **inhabit tropical and subtropical forests** in Africa. Although their range **covers only a small percentage of Africa**, they **adapt to a wide range of elevations**.</p>

        <p>The **mountain gorilla** inhabits the **Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes**, living at altitudes ranging **from 2,200 to 4,300 meters (7,200 to 14,100 ft)**. The **lowland gorillas**, on the other hand, **thrive in dense forests, swamps, and marshlands** at lower elevations.</p>

        <p>- **Western lowland gorillas** reside in **Central West African countries**.  
        - **Eastern lowland gorillas** are found in the **Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda**.</p>

        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
        <p>You will find the gorilla cage at **GO12**.</p>
