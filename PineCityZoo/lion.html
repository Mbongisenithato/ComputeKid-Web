        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The lion (*Panthera leo*) is one of the five big cats in the genus *Panthera* and a **member of the Felidae family**. The commonly used term **African lion** refers to **multiple subspecies found in Africa**. Some male lions **exceed 250 kg (550 lb) in weight**, making them the **second-largest living cat after the tiger**.</p>

        <h3>Historical & Current Range</h3>
        <p>Wild lions currently **exist in sub-Saharan Africa** and **Asia**, where an **endangered population resides in Gir Forest National Park, India**. Other lion populations **once roamed North Africa and Southwest Asia**, but **have since disappeared**.</p>

        <p>Up until the **late Pleistocene epoch**, about **10,000 years ago**, lions were **the second-most widespread land mammal after humans**. They were found across most of Africa, **Eurasia from western Europe to India**, and even the **Americas, from the Yukon to Peru**.</p>

        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>Lions are a **vulnerable species**, experiencing a **major population decline** across **30‚Äì50% of their African range every two decades** during the **second half of the twentieth century**. Their populations **cannot thrive outside designated reserves and national parks**, making conservation efforts crucial.</p>

        <p>Although the **exact cause of their decline is unclear**, **habitat loss and human conflict** pose **significant threats**. Within Africa, the **West African lion population** is particularly endangered.</p>

        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
        <p>You will find the lions at **the Northern Frontier**.</p>
