        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The **tiger** (*Panthera tigris*) is the **largest wild cat species** and one of the most **powerful predators** in the world. With its **striking orange coat** adorned with **bold black stripes**, the tiger is **instantly recognizable** and a symbol of **strength and agility**.</p>

        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Tigers have **muscular bodies**, powerful limbs, and **sharp retractable claws**, making them **highly efficient hunters**. They can reach **up to 3.3 meters (11 ft) in length**, including their tail, and weigh **between 65 to 306 kg (143 to 675 lb)** depending on the subspecies. Their **striped fur provides camouflage** in dense forests and grasslands.</p>

        <h3>Habitat & Range</h3>
        <p>Tigers are **native to Asia**, occupying a range of habitats including **tropical forests, mangroves, grasslands, and snowy mountain regions**. Historically, tigers roamed **vast areas from Eastern Russia to South and Southeast Asia**, but habitat loss has dramatically reduced their population.</p>

        <h3>Diet & Hunting Behavior</h3>
        <p>As **apex predators**, tigers rely on their **stealth and power** to hunt prey such as **deer, wild boar, buffalo, and occasionally even crocodiles**. Unlike most big cats, tigers are **strong swimmers** and often **hunt near water sources**.</p>

        <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
        <p>Tigers are **endangered**, with their numbers declining due to **deforestation, poaching, and habitat destruction**. Conservation efforts, including **protected reserves and anti-poaching initiatives**, are crucial in ensuring their survival.</p>

        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
        <p>You will find the tigers at **Tiger Mountain, near the eastern section of the zoo**.</p>
