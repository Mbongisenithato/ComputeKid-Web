        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognized: the African elephant (*Loxodonta africana*) and the Asian elephant (*Elephas maximus*). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals, reaching up to 4 m (13 ft) in height and weighing as much as 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>

        <h3>Distinctive Features</h3>
        <p>All elephants share several notable features, the most iconic being their **long trunk**, which is used for breathing, lifting water, grasping objects, and communication. Their **incisors grow into tusks**, serving as powerful tools for digging, defense, and moving objects. Elephants have **large ear flaps** that help regulate their body temperature. Their **pillar-like legs** support their immense weight.</p>

        <p>African elephants have **larger ears** and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have **smaller ears** and convex or level backs.</p>

        <h3>Habitat & Diet</h3>
        <p>Elephants are herbivorous and inhabit various environments such as **savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes**. They thrive near water sources, where they can cool off and hydrate frequently.</p>

        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
        <p>You will find the elephants at **pen E22**, right next to the amphitheater.</p>
