        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The giraffe (*Giraffa camelopardalis*) is an African **even-toed ungulate mammal**, the **tallest living terrestrial animal** and the **largest ruminant**. Its species name references its **camel-like shape** and **leopard-like colouring**. Its chief distinguishing characteristics include its **extremely long neck and legs**, **horn-like ossicones**, and **distinctive coat patterns**. It belongs to the **Giraffidae family**, alongside its closest relative, the **okapi**. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their **coat patterns**.</p>

        <h3>Range & Habitat</h3>
        <p>The giraffeâ€™s range extends **from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east**. Giraffes primarily inhabit **savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands**. Their main food source is **acacia leaves**, which they browse at **heights most other herbivores cannot reach**.</p>

        <h3>Behavior & Social Structure</h3>
        <p>Giraffes are preyed on by **lions**, while their calves are also targeted by **leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs**. Adult giraffes **do not form strong social bonds**, though they **gather in loose groups** if traveling in the same direction. Males establish **social hierarchies through "necking"**, a combat practice where the **neck is used as a weapon**. Dominant males gain **mating access to females**, while females alone bear the responsibility for raising young.</p>

        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
        <p>You will find the giraffes at **G15, just beyond the research centre**.</p>
