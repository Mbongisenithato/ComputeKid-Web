        <h2>KOALAS üê®</h2>
        <img src="images/koala.jpg" alt="Koala">

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The koala (*Phascolarctos cinereus*), sometimes inaccurately called "koala bear," is an **arboreal herbivorous marsupial** native to Australia. It is the **only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae**, and its closest living relatives are **wombats**. Koalas are found in **coastal areas of the mainland‚Äôs eastern and southern regions**, inhabiting **Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia**.</p>

        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Koalas are **easily recognizable** by their **stout, tailless body**, **large head**, **round, fluffy ears**, and **large, spoon-shaped nose**. Their body length ranges **from 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 in)**, and their weight varies **from 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 lb)**. Their **pelage color** ranges from **silver-grey to chocolate brown**. Northern populations of koalas tend to be **smaller and lighter in color** than those further south.</p>

        <h3>Habitat & Behavior</h3>
        <p>Koalas primarily **inhabit open eucalypt woodlands**, and their **diet consists mostly of eucalyptus leaves**. Since eucalyptus has **limited nutritional value**, koalas are **largely sedentary** and can **sleep up to 20 hours a day**.</p>

        <p>Koalas are **asocial animals**, with **bonding occurring only between mothers and their offspring**. Adult males **communicate with loud bellows**, used to **intimidate rivals and attract mates**. They **mark their presence** using **secretions from scent glands located on their chests**.</p>

        <h3>Reproduction & Threats</h3>
        <p>Being **marsupials**, koalas give birth to **underdeveloped young** that **crawl into their mother‚Äôs pouch**, staying there **for the first 6‚Äì7 months of their lives**. These young, called **joeys**, are fully weaned **around one year old**.</p>

        <p>Koalas have **few natural predators**, but they are **threatened by diseases**, including **Chlamydiaceae bacteria** and the **koala retrovirus**, as well as **bushfires and droughts**.</p>

        <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3>
        <p>You will find the koalas **next to the giraffe enclosure**.</p>
